## Introduction

This document outlines the structured criteria for evaluating both the individual components and the integrated
framework effectiveness. These criteria provide a consistent approach to verifying that assessments meet quality
standards and effectively address fairness concerns.

## Framework Evaluation Dimensions

The Fairness Audit Framework is evaluated along four key dimensions:

1. **Functional Assessment**: Does the framework perform its intended functions completely and correctly?
2. **Fairness Effectiveness**: Does the framework successfully identify and address fairness issues?
3. **Usability Evaluation**: Can the framework be practically applied by intended users?
4. **Limitations Assessment**: Are the boundaries and constraints of the framework clearly understood?

## Continuous Improvement Process

The evaluation criteria themselves should be periodically reviewed and updated based on:

1. New fairness research and methodologies
2. Feedback from framework implementation
3. Emerging regulatory requirements
4. Technological changes in AI development

Updates to evaluation criteria should follow the framework's versioning protocol with clear documentation of changes and
rationale.
