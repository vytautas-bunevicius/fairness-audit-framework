## Introduction

This document outlines how the four components of the Fairness Audit Framework connect into a cohesive assessment
system.

## Component Integration Architecture

The Fairness Audit Framework integrates four complementary components through standardized interfaces and data exchange
formats:

### Information Flow

Each component produces outputs that feed directly into subsequent components:

1. **Historical Context Assessment Tool**
    - **Output**: Historical pattern registry with relevance scores
    - **Feeds into**: Fairness Definition Selection to prioritize definitions addressing historical patterns

2. **Fairness Definition Selection Framework**
    - **Output**: Selected fairness definitions with justification
    - **Feeds into**: Bias Source Identification to prioritize sources relevant to selected definitions

3. **Bias Source Identification Methodology**
    - **Output**: Bias source catalog with risk assessment
    - **Feeds into**: Metrics Framework to select appropriate measurement approaches

4. **Comprehensive Metrics Framework**
    - **Output**: Implemented metrics with results and interpretation
    - **Feeds back into**: Iterative refinement of other components

## Standardized Data Exchange Formats

          0.11,
          0.19
        ],
        "interpretation": "15% disparity in selection rates between groups",
        "threshold_assessment": "Exceeds acceptable threshold"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Integration Methods

### 1. Sequential Integration

For standard assessments, components are executed in sequence with clear handoffs between stages:

1. Begin with Historical Context Assessment
2. Use outputs to guide Fairness Definition Selection
3. Apply selected definitions to direct Bias Source Identification
4. Implement metrics based on prioritized bias sources
5. Document results in standardized formats

### 2. Parallel Integration

For comprehensive assessments, components may be executed with partial parallelization:

1. Begin with initial Historical Context Assessment
2. Conduct preliminary Fairness Definition Selection
3. Run parallel assessment of Bias Sources and refined Historical Context
4. Iteratively refine definitions based on emerging bias insights
5. Implement metrics in progressive waves as definitions stabilize

### 3. Iterative Integration

For continuous monitoring, components operate in continuous feedback loops:

1. Establish baseline assessment across all components
2. Monitor metric results over time
3. When significant shifts occur, trigger bias source re-evaluation
4. Periodically revisit historical context and fairness definitions
5. Document evolution of assessment over system lifetime

## Cross-Component Analysis

The framework supports cross-component analysis through:

1. **Consistency Verification**: Checks alignment between historical patterns and implemented metrics
2. **Coverage Assessment**: Ensures selected definitions address identified bias sources
3. **Gap Identification**: Highlights inconsistencies between component findings
4. **Impact Tracing**: Connects metric results to specific bias sources and historical patterns

## Integration Governance

To maintain assessment integrity:

1. **Version Control**: Each component assessment is versioned with dependencies clearly documented
2. **Change Management**: Modifications to earlier components trigger impact assessment on subsequent components
3. **Peer Review**: Cross-component reviews verify integration quality
4. **Completeness Verification**: Automated checks ensure all required connections between components exist
