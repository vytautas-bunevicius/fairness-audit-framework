## Selecting a Workflow

Choose the appropriate workflow based on your AI system's risk level and assessment needs:

### Rapid Assessment Workflow

**When to use**: For initial screening, lower-risk applications, or time-constrained assessments.

**Implementation steps**:

1. Complete the [Assessment Plan Template](../../templates/assessment/assessment-plan.md) with a focused scope
2. Follow the [Rapid Assessment Workflow](../workflows/01-rapid-assessment.md)
3. Use simplified documentation templates

### Comprehensive Assessment Workflow

**When to use**: For high-stakes AI systems with significant potential impact on individuals or groups.

**Implementation steps**:

1. Complete the full [Assessment Plan Template](../../templates/assessment/assessment-plan.md)
2. Follow the [Comprehensive Assessment Workflow](../workflows/02-comprehensive-assessment.md)
3. Complete all documentation templates with full detail

### Regulatory Compliance Workflow

**When to use**: For AI systems that must demonstrate compliance with specific regulations.

**Implementation steps**:

1. Complete the compliance-focused [Assessment Plan Template](../../templates/assessment/assessment-plan.md)
2. Follow the [Regulatory Compliance Workflow](../workflows/04-regulatory-compliance.md)
3. Focus on documentation templates most relevant to regulatory requirements

## Implementing Framework Components

### 1. Historical Context Assessment

**Key activities**:

- Research relevant historical patterns of discrimination in the domain

- Expert consultation interviews

### 2. Fairness Definition Selection

**Key activities**:

- Review potential fairness definitions in light of identified historical patterns
- Apply decision trees to narrow definition options
- Conduct trade-off analysis between competing definitions
- Document rationale using
  the [Fairness Definition Rationale Template](../../templates/assessment/fairness-definition.md)

**Implementation tips**:

- Consider multiple fairness definitions rather than assuming one is sufficient
- Explicitly document trade-offs between different definitions
- Involve stakeholders in definition prioritization decisions
- Ensure mathematical formulation of selected definitions is precise

**Tools and resources**:

- Review feature engineering and selection approaches
- Evaluate model architecture and training procedures
- Document findings using
  the [Bias Source Mapping Template](../../templates/assessment/bias-source-mapping.md)

**Implementation tips**:

- Examine the full AI lifecycle, not just the model itself
- Prioritize bias sources based on risk assessment
- Consider proxies for protected attributes
- Document both identified and potential bias sources

**Tools and resources**:

- Google's What-If Tool for exploring feature interactions
- Data profiling tools for dataset analysis
- Checklists for common bias sources
- Risk assessment frameworks

### 4. Comprehensive Metrics Implementation

**Key activities**:

- Select metrics aligned with chosen fairness definitions
- Implement metrics with statistical validation
- Calculate metrics across different data slices
- Document implementation using
  the [Metrics Implementation Template](../../templates/assessment/metrics-implementation.md)

**Implementation tips**:

- Use established libraries for metric calculation
- Implement multiple metrics to capture different aspects of fairness
- Conduct intersectional analysis across subgroups
- Include confidence intervals for statistical validation

**Tools and resources**:

- IBM AI Fairness 360 for comprehensive metrics
- Microsoft Fairlearn for visualization and comparison
- Statistical validation frameworks
- Intersectional analysis techniques

    - Maintain versioned documentation for audit purposes

## Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

### Monitoring Fairness

Implement ongoing fairness monitoring after initial assessment:

1. **Metric Tracking**:
    - Monitor key fairness metrics over time
    - Set alerts for significant changes

2. **Feedback Collection**:
    - Gather user and stakeholder feedback on fairness
    - Track complaints or concerns related to bias

3. **Periodic Reassessment**:
    - Conduct full reassessment after significant changes
    - Schedule regular review of Historical Context Assessment

### Continuous Improvement

Establish processes for ongoing framework improvement:

1. **Lessons Learned**:
    - Document challenges and successes in framework application
    - Share case studies across teams

2. **Tool and Template Updates**:
    - Refine templates based on user feedback
    - Incorporate new fairness tools as they emerge

3. **Knowledge Sharing**:
    - Build community of practice around fairness assessment
    - Conduct training sessions on framework components

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Common Challenges and Solutions

1. **Insufficient Historical Data**:
    - Consult with domain experts and advocacy organizations
    - Supplement with broader historical patterns and analogous cases

2. **Competing Fairness Definitions**:
    - Clearly document trade-offs and rationale for prioritization
    - Consider implementing multiple definitions with threshold ranges

3. **Limited Access to Protected Attributes**:
    - Explore proxy-based approaches with careful validation
    - Consider synthetic data for testing or privacy-preserving techniques

4. **Resource Constraints**:
    - Start with Rapid Assessment Workflow and expand
    - Focus on highest-risk components of the system

5. **Stakeholder Disagreement**:
    - Document different perspectives explicitly
    - Use structured decision-making techniques for resolution
