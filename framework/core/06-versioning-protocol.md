# Versioning Protocol

This document outlines the standardized approach for versioning fairness assessments, assessment components, and the
framework itself. Effective versioning is essential for tracking changes over time, understanding the evolution of
fairness assessments, and maintaining clear documentation of assessment history.

## Principles of Effective Versioning

The versioning protocol follows these key principles:

1. **Traceability**: All changes should be traceable to specific versions
2. **Dependency Tracking**: Dependencies between components should be explicitly documented
3. **Rationale Documentation**: The reason for changes should be documented
4. **Change Impact Assessment**: Impact of changes on other components should be evaluated
5. **Accessibility**: Version history should be accessible to all stakeholders
6. **Consistency**: Versioning approach should be consistent across all components

## Framework Versioning

### Version Numbering Scheme

The framework uses semantic versioning with three components:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- **MAJOR**: Incremented for incompatible changes that require significant adaptation of existing assessments
- **MINOR**: Incremented for functionality additions or improvements that maintain backward compatibility
- **PATCH**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes or minor documentation improvements

### Framework Component Versioning

Each major component of the framework is versioned independently:

| Component                     | Current Version | Last Updated | Change Frequency |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| Historical Context Assessment | 1.2.0           | 2025-02-15   | Low              |
| Fairness Definition Selection | 1.3.1           | 2025-03-10   | Medium           |
| Bias Source Identification    | 1.1.0           | 2025-01-20   | Low              |
| Comprehensive Metrics         | 1.4.2           | 2025-03-25   | High             |
| Integration Methodology       | 1.2.1           | 2025-03-01   | Medium           |

### Version History Documentation

For each component, maintain a version history that includes:

```markdown
## Version History

### v1.2.0 (2025-02-15)

- Added support for intersectional historical pattern analysis
- Improved evidence documentation templates
- Fixed inconsistency in pattern relevance scoring guidance

### v1.1.0 (2024-11-10)

- Added structured methodology for evaluating pattern relevance
- Expanded historical pattern catalog with 15 new patterns
- Improved documentation on evidence standards

### v1.0.0 (2024-08-01)

- Initial release of Historical Context Assessment component
```

## Assessment Versioning

### Assessment Identifier Format

Each assessment receives a unique identifier with the format:

```
FAF-YYYY-MM-###
```

- **FAF**: Fairness Audit Framework prefix
- **YYYY-MM**: Year and month of initial assessment
- **###**: Sequential number within that month

Example: `FAF-2025-04-003` (third assessment started in April 2025)

### Assessment Version Numbering

Each assessment uses a simple incremental versioning scheme:

```
MAJOR.MINOR
```

- **MAJOR**: Incremented for substantial reassessments or system changes
- **MINOR**: Incremented for updates, corrections, or minor changes

### Component Version Documentation

Each assessment must document the framework component versions used:

```markdown
## Framework Versions Used

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Historical Context Assessment | 1.2.0 |
| Fairness Definition Selection | 1.3.1 |
| Bias Source Identification | 1.1.0 |
| Comprehensive Metrics | 1.4.2 |
| Integration Methodology | 1.2.1 |
```

## Versioning Documentation Requirements

### Version Change Log

For each assessment version update, document:

1. **Version Number**: New version number
2. **Date**: Date of update
3. **Author**: Person responsible for the update
4. **Change Type**: Category of change (e.g., correction, update, expansion)
5. **Components Modified**: Which assessment components were modified
6. **Change Summary**: Brief description of changes made
7. **Rationale**: Reason for the changes
8. **Impact Assessment**: How changes affect overall assessment findings

Example:

```markdown
## Version Change Log

### Version 1.2 (2025-06-15)

- **Author**: Jane Smith
- **Change Type**: Update
- **Components Modified**: Bias Source Identification, Metrics Implementation
- **Change Summary**: Added analysis of three additional bias sources and implemented two new metrics to measure their
  impact
- **Rationale**: New research identified previously unknown bias mechanisms relevant to the system
- **Impact Assessment**: New bias sources have medium impact on overall findings, increasing estimated disparate impact
  by approximately 5%
```

### Change Impact Matrix

For significant changes (new major versions), create a change impact matrix:

| Component          | Change Description                      | Impact on Other Components                       | Stakeholder Communication Needed |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Historical Context | Added redlining pattern analysis        | Requires update to Fairness Definition Selection | Yes - notify policy team         |
| Metrics            | Recalibrated demographic parity measure | Results changed by 3% but conclusions unchanged  | No - minor technical change      |

## Triggering Version Updates

### Automatic Triggers

Assessment versions should be updated when:

1. System functionality changes significantly
2. New training data is incorporated
3. New fairness definitions are adopted
4. Additional protected attributes are considered
5. New bias sources are identified
6. Metric implementation methodology changes
7. Regulatory requirements change
8. Significant stakeholder feedback is incorporated

### Periodic Review Triggers

Schedule regular version reviews:

- **Minor review**: Quarterly
- **Major review**: Annually or with significant system changes

## Version Control Implementation

### Repository Structure

For GitHub-based version control:

```
/assessments
  /FAF-2025-04-003
    /v1.0
      - assessment-plan.md
      - historical-context-report.md
      - ...
    /v1.1
      - assessment-plan.md
      - historical-context-report.md
      - ...
    - VERSION.md
```

### Version Metadata File

Each assessment includes a `VERSION.md` file with:

```markdown
# Version Information

## Current Version

- Version Number: 1.2
- Release Date: 2025-06-15
- Lead Assessor: Jane Smith

## Component Versions

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Historical Context Assessment | 1.2.0 |
| Fairness Definition Selection | 1.3.1 |
| Bias Source Identification | 1.1.0 |
| Comprehensive Metrics | 1.4.2 |
| Integration Methodology | 1.2.1 |

## Version History

- v1.2: 2025-06-15 - Added new bias sources and metrics
- v1.1: 2025-05-10 - Updated historical context with new research
- v1.0: 2025-04-20 - Initial assessment
```

## Cross-Version Analysis

### Longitudinal Assessment

For systems assessed multiple times, include cross-version analysis:

```markdown
## Longitudinal Analysis

### Fairness Metric Trends

| Metric | v1.0 | v1.1 | v1.2 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|------|-------|
| Demographic Parity | 0.82 | 0.85 | 0.88 | Improving |
| Equal Opportunity | 0.76 | 0.79 | 0.85 | Improving |
| Predictive Parity | 0.91 | 0.92 | 0.91 | Stable |

### Key Improvements

- Bias source BS003 (training data imbalance) shows 35% reduction since initial assessment
- Intersectional disparities decreased across 4/5 measured dimensions
- Documentation completeness increased from 82% to 97%
```

## Stakeholder Communication

### Version Update Notifications

When releasing new assessment versions:

1. **Change Notification**: Summarize key changes in non-technical language
2. **Impact Statement**: Explain how changes affect conclusions and recommendations
3. **Action Items**: Identify any new actions required based on changes
4. **Documentation Links**: Provide access to detailed change documentation

Example stakeholder notification:

```
Subject: Fairness Assessment Update (v1.2) - [System Name]

Dear Stakeholders,

We've updated the fairness assessment for [System Name] to version 1.2. Key changes include:

• Added analysis of how the system handles non-traditional income sources
• Implemented new metrics measuring impact on single-parent households
• Updated our historical context with recently published research

Impact: These changes revealed a previously unidentified 8% disparity for applicants with seasonal income. We've added a new recommendation addressing this finding.

The complete assessment is available at [link]. Please contact [name] with any questions.

Regards,
Fairness Assessment Team
```
