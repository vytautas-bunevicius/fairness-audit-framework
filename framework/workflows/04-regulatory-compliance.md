This workflow is specifically designed to produce comprehensive documentation that satisfies regulatory and compliance
requirements for AI fairness. Use this workflow when preparing documentation for regulatory submission, legal
compliance, or formal governance processes.

The regulatory compliance workflow follows this structured approach:

1. **Regulatory Mapping**
2. **Historical Context Documentation**
3. **Fairness Definition Justification**
4. **Comprehensive Bias Documentation**
5. **Metrics Implementation & Validation**
6. **Evidence Compilation**
7. **Compliance Documentation Package**

## Detailed Workflow Steps

### 1. Regulatory Mapping

**Objective**: Identify all applicable regulations and requirements related to fairness and non-discrimination.

**Activities**:

- Conduct regulatory inventory of applicable laws and guidelines
- Map specific regulatory requirements to assessment components
- Identify documentation and evidence requirements
- Establish compliance criteria and thresholds
- Engage legal and compliance stakeholders

**Outputs**:

- Regulatory Requirement Matrix
- Evidence Requirements Catalog
- Compliance Criteria Document

**Connections**:

- Guides the entire assessment process
- Establishes documentation requirements

**Documentation**:

- Create custom section in Assessment Plan for regulatory mapping

### 2. Historical Context Documentation

**Objective**: Thoroughly document relevant historical patterns of discrimination with emphasis on regulatory context.

**Activities**:

- Research historical patterns with focus on regulatory concerns
- Document relevant legal precedents and enforcement actions
- Connect historical patterns to specific regulatory provisions
- Assess pattern relevance using regulatory criteria
- Validate patterns with legal and subject matter experts

**Outputs**:

- Regulatory-focused Historical Pattern Registry
- Legal Precedent Analysis
- Regulatory Risk Mapping

**Connections**:

- Provides foundation for fairness definition selection
- Establishes historical basis for regulatory concerns

**Documentation**:

- Complete the [Historical Context Report Template](../../templates/assessment/historical-context.md) with added
  regulatory section

### 3. Fairness Definition Justification

**Objective**: Select and thoroughly justify fairness definitions with explicit connections to regulatory requirements.

**Activities**:

- Select fairness definitions addressing regulatory concerns
- Document explicit rationale linked to regulatory provisions
- Analyze regulatory precedents for definition acceptance
- Consider jurisdiction-specific interpretation requirements
- Document definition appropriateness with legal justification

**Outputs**:

- Regulatory-aligned Fairness Definitions
- Formal Definition Justification
- Compliance Rationale Document

**Connections**:

- Guided by regulatory mapping
- Directs focus of bias source identification
- Determines metrics required for compliance

**Documentation**:

- Complete the [Fairness Definition Rationale Template](../../templates/assessment/fairness-definition.md) with expanded
  regulatory justification

### 4. Comprehensive Bias Documentation

**Objective**: Exhaustively document potential bias sources with emphasis on regulatory risk areas.

**Activities**:

- Conduct thorough lifecycle analysis with regulatory lens
- Document all potential bias sources, emphasizing regulatory hotspots
- Assess severity using compliance-focused risk criteria
- Document mitigation approaches with compliance justification
- Validate bias assessment with legal and compliance experts

**Outputs**:

- Comprehensive Bias Source Catalog
- Regulatory Risk Assessment
- Mitigation Documentation

**Connections**:

- Informed by regulatory requirements
- Guides metrics implementation
- Provides basis for evidence compilation

**Documentation**:

- Complete the [Bias Source Mapping Template](../../templates/assessment/bias-source-mapping.md) with expanded
  compliance sections

### 5. Metrics Implementation & Validation

**Objective**: Implement metrics with rigorous statistical validation that meets evidentiary standards.

**Activities**:

- Select metrics addressing regulatory fairness requirements
- Implement with thorough statistical validation
- Document methodology with statistical rigor
- Conduct extensive significance testing and robustness checks
- Benchmark against regulatory thresholds where available

**Outputs**:

- Regulatory Metrics Package
- Statistical Validation Documentation
- Threshold Analysis Report

**Connections**:

- Based on regulatory fairness definitions
- Documents quantitative evidence for compliance
- Feeds into compliance documentation

**Documentation**:

- Complete the [Metrics Implementation Template](../../templates/assessment/metrics-implementation.md) with added
  statistical validation
- Complete the [Intersectional Analysis Template](../../templates/assessment/intersectional-analysis.md) with regulatory
  context

### 6. Evidence Compilation

**Objective**: Assemble comprehensive evidence package demonstrating compliance efforts.

**Activities**:

- Collect documentation from all previous components
- Organize evidence according to regulatory requirements
- Document assessment methodology with compliance framing
- Create traceability matrix connecting evidence to requirements
- Validate evidence package with legal experts

**Outputs**:

- Evidence Catalog
- Traceability Matrix
- Methodology Documentation

**Connections**:

- Integrates outputs from all components
- Prepares for regulatory submission

**Documentation**:

- Create Evidence Compilation Document (custom template)
- Complete the [Limitations Acknowledgment Template](../../templates/assessment/limitations.md) with regulatory context

### 7. Compliance Documentation Package

**Objective**: Produce final documentation package ready for regulatory submission or governance review.

**Activities**:

- Create executive summary for compliance stakeholders
- Finalize technical documentation with regulatory framing
- Produce jurisdiction-specific compliance statements
- Document ongoing monitoring and reporting plans
- Create non-technical overview for general audience

**Outputs**:

- Complete Compliance Documentation Package
- Executive Summary for Regulators
- Ongoing Compliance Plan

**Connections**:

- Final synthesis of all components
- Ready for submission or governance review

**Documentation**:

- Complete the [Executive Summary Template](../../templates/assessment/executive-summary.md) with compliance focus
- Create Regulatory Submission Package (custom format)

## Regulatory Framework Adaptations

### EU AI Act Adaptation

For systems subject to the EU AI Act:

- **Risk Classification**: Determine whether system is "high-risk" under AI Act criteria
- **Documentation Requirements**: Adapt to specific Article 11 and Annex IV requirements
- **Conformity Assessment**: Include preparation for conformity assessment procedures
- **Technical Documentation**: Structure according to Annex IV specifications
- **Risk Management**: Integrate with Article 9 risk management requirements

### EEOC/US Employment Adaptation

For employment systems subject to US regulations:

- **Four-Fifths Rule**: Include specific analysis of selection rates under four-fifths rule
- **Business Necessity**: Document justification for practices with disparate impact
- **Alternative Practices**: Analyze less discriminatory alternatives
- **Validation Studies**: Include job-relatedness and business necessity documentation
- **UGESP Compliance**: Structure documentation to address Uniform Guidelines requirements

### Financial Services Adaptation

For credit or financial systems:

- **ECOA/Regulation B**: Structure to address adverse action documentation requirements
- **Fair Lending**: Include comparative file review documentation
- **Model Risk**: Integrate with SR 11-7 or equivalent model risk governance
- **Disparate Impact Analysis**: Follow established regulatory methodologies
- **Special Purpose Credit Programs**: Document justification if applicable

## Documentation Considerations

### Evidentiary Standards

Documentation must meet these evidentiary standards:

1. **Completeness**: Address all applicable regulatory requirements
2. **Traceability**: Clear connections between requirements and evidence
3. **Methodology**: Well-documented, defensible assessment approach
4. **Statistical Rigor**: Appropriate statistical validation
5. **Limitations**: Transparent acknowledgment of constraints

### Confidentiality Balance

Balance these competing needs:

1. **Regulatory Transparency**: Provide sufficient detail for regulatory review
2. **Intellectual Property**: Protect proprietary algorithms and methods
3. **Security**: Avoid exposing system vulnerabilities
4. **Privacy**: Protect personal data in documentation
