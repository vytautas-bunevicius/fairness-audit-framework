# Fairness Audit Framework

This project provides a practical way to systematically check AI systems for fairness.

## What it Does

It helps you figure out if your AI might be biased by looking at:
1.  **History:** What past discrimination relates to your AI's job?
2.  **Definition:** What does "fairness" mean for *this specific* AI?
3.  **Bias Sources:** Where could bias sneak into your AI's design or data?
4.  **Metrics:** How can you measure if the AI is meeting your fairness goals?

This structured approach helps avoid guesswork and provides clear documentation.

## Getting Started

**The main guide to using this framework is in `framework/guide.md`.**

That guide explains the parts, how they fit together, and how to choose a process (workflow) to follow from the `framework/workflows/` folder. You'll use the standard documents in the `templates/` folder as you go.

For specific situations like different industries or legal rules, check the guides in `resources/`. You can see examples in `case-studies/`.
