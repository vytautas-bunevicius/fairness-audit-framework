This repository contains a comprehensive methodology and associated resources for conducting systematic fairness
assessments of AI systems.

## Overview

The Fairness Audit Framework addresses the fundamental challenge of systematically assessing fairness in AI systems.
Without structured evaluation methodologies, fairness remains an aspirational goal rather than a verifiable property.
This framework integrates four critical components into a cohesive audit system:

1. **Historical Context Assessment**: Identifies and maps historical patterns of discrimination to specific AI
   application risks.
2. **Fairness Definition Selection**: Provides guidance for selecting appropriate fairness definitions based on context.
3. **Bias Source Identification**: Delivers systematic approaches for locating potential bias sources throughout the AI
   lifecycle.
4. **Metrics Implementation & Analysis**: Establishes techniques for selecting, implementing, and interpreting fairness
   metrics.

This structured approach helps organizations determine whether their AI systems perpetuate historical biases, satisfy
fairness requirements, or require intervention.
The framework is designed with clear integration between components,
where outputs from each stage serve as inputs to subsequent stages, creating a cohesive assessment process.

## How to Navigate and Use This Framework

This repository is organized to guide you through the assessment process. Here's how to get started:

**1. Start Here: The Framework Overview**

* Begin by reading **[`framework/core/01-overview.md`](framework/core/01-overview.md)**. This is the main entry point
  that explains the core concepts, the four components, how they integrate, and how to plan your assessment.
* This overview document explains how each component connects to the next in a logical flow:
    * Historical Context Assessment → Fairness Definition Selection → Bias Source Identification → Metrics
      Implementation
    * Each component produces specific outputs that serve as inputs to subsequent stages

**2. Understand the Repository Structure**

**3. Choose Your Assessment Process (Workflow)**

* Based on your needs (identified in your assessment plan), select the appropriate workflow from the
  `framework/workflows/` directory. Your chosen workflow will guide you through the necessary steps and reference the
  relevant templates and guides.
    * **Initial Screening/Low-Risk**: [`01-rapid-assessment.md`](framework/workflows/01-rapid-assessment.md)
    * **High-Stakes/In-Depth**: [`02-comprehensive-assessment.md`](framework/workflows/02-comprehensive-assessment.md)
    * **Ongoing Checks**: [`03-continuous-monitoring.md`](framework/workflows/03-continuous-monitoring.md) (For systems
      already assessed and deployed)
    * **Compliance Needs**: [`04-regulatory-compliance.md`](framework/workflows/04-regulatory-compliance.md)

**4. Execute the Workflow Using Templates and Guides**

* Follow the steps outlined in your chosen workflow document.
* Use the corresponding templates from the organized `templates/` subdirectories:
    * **Assessment templates**: [`templates/assessment/`](templates/assessment/) (e.g., [
      `assessment-plan.md`](templates/assessment/assessment-plan.md), [
      `historical-context.md`](templates/assessment/historical-context.md), [
      `metrics-implementation.md`](templates/assessment/metrics-implementation.md))
