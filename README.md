# Fairness Audit Framework

A comprehensive methodology for systematic fairness assessment in AI systems.

## Overview

The Fairness Audit Framework addresses the fundamental challenge of systematically assessing fairness in AI systems. Without structured evaluation methodologies, fairness remains an aspirational goal rather than a verifiable property. This framework integrates four critical components into a cohesive audit system:

1. **Historical Context Assessment Tool** - Identifies and maps historical patterns of discrimination to specific AI application risks
2. **Fairness Definition Selection Framework** - Provides decision trees and comparison matrices for selecting appropriate fairness definitions
3. **Bias Source Identification Methodology** - Delivers systematic approaches for locating potential bias sources throughout the AI lifecycle
4. **Comprehensive Metrics Framework** - Establishes techniques for selecting, implementing, and interpreting fairness metrics

## Framework Applications

The completed framework directly improves fairness outcomes in various real-world scenarios:

- **Pre-deployment assessment** of hiring algorithms
- **Regulatory compliance documentation** for loan approval systems
- **Iterative improvement** of healthcare resource allocation models
- **Fairness verification** for public service eligibility systems

## Getting Started

1. Review the integration methodology in `framework/integration-methodology.md`
2. Choose an appropriate workflow from `framework/workflows/` based on your application context:
   - `rapid-assessment.md` for initial screening
   - `comprehensive-assessment.md` for high-stakes applications
   - `regulatory-compliance.md` for documentation focused on compliance
3. Use templates from the `templates/` directory for standardized documentation
4. Reference case studies in `case-studies/` for practical examples

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to improve the framework. Please see our contribution guidelines before submitting changes.
