# AI Fairness: Stakeholder Engagement and Intersectional Analysis Guide

This guide covers two critical aspects of fairness assessment: meaningfully engaging diverse stakeholders (Part 1) and analyzing fairness for overlapping, intersectional groups (Part 2).

## Part 1: Engaging Stakeholders Effectively

Fairness isn't just technical; it's social and contextual. Engaging stakeholders, especially those affected by the AI, is vital.

### Why Engage Stakeholders?

*   **Get Real-World Context:** Understand impacts technical data can miss.
*   **Define "Fairness" Meaningfully:** Incorporate diverse values into Fairness Definition Selection (FDS).
*   **Identify Unforeseen Harms:** Surface potential negative consequences.
*   **Spot Subtle Bias Sources:** Leverage lived experience to find issues (e.g., in data collection).
*   **Build Trust & Legitimacy:** Participatory processes are more accepted.
*   **Find Practical Solutions:** Get realistic input on effective interventions.

### Identifying Stakeholders

Think broadly beyond the technical team:
*   **Directly Affected:** People impacted by the AI's decisions (e.g., patients, applicants). *Prioritize engaging these groups.*
*   **Operators:** Daily users (e.g., doctors, recruiters).
*   **Developers:** The build team.
*   **Domain Experts:** Field specialists.
*   **Advocacy Groups:** Representing communities.
*   **Legal/Compliance/Ethics:** Oversight roles.
*   **Leadership:** Decision-makers.

**Action:** Map stakeholders in your `assessment-plan.md`. Consider power dynamics â€“ whose voices might be marginalized? Plan *how* and *when* to engage using `templates/stakeholder-documentation.md` to track activities and input.

### How to Engage (Methods)

Use varied methods: Interviews, Surveys, Focus Groups, Co-design Workshops, Advisory Boards, Feedback Portals. Choose based on goals and participants. Workshops are great for collaborative definition or analysis.

### Facilitating Equitable Engagement

*   **Accessibility:** Address language, tech comfort, physical/virtual access, timing needs.
*   **Manage Power:** Use techniques like structured turn-taking, anonymous input, balanced groups to ensure quieter voices are heard.
*   **Safety:** Set ground rules for respect. Value lived experience as expertise. Offer multiple ways to contribute (speaking, writing, drawing).
*   **Transparency:** Be clear on how input will be used.
*   **Compensation:** Value participants' time, especially community members.
*   **Documentation:** Get consent. Clarify attribution. Share back summaries. Use `templates/stakeholder-documentation.md`.

### Integrating Stakeholder Input

*   **Link Explicitly:** Connect input to specific assessment parts (e.g., "Historical pattern X validated by stakeholder workshop," "Definition Y prioritized based on advocate feedback"). Document this in relevant templates and summarize in `templates/stakeholder-documentation.md`.
*   **Document Disagreements:** Note conflicting views and explain the rationale for final decisions.

## Part 2: Analyzing Intersectional Fairness

People belong to multiple groups (race, gender, age, disability, etc.). Intersectionality looks at fairness at these overlaps, where bias can be unique or amplified.

### Why Analyze Intersections?

*   **Reveal Hidden Bias:** An AI might seem fair comparing men vs. women and fair comparing White vs. Black people, but be very unfair to Black women specifically.
*   **Understand Compounding Effects:** Disadvantage can accumulate differently at intersections.
*   **Target Interventions:** Solutions might need tailoring for specific intersectional groups.

### Challenges

*   **Data Sparsity:** Subgroups become small, making statistics less reliable.
*   **Complexity:** Many possible intersections to check.
*   **Prioritization:** Need to focus on the most relevant intersections.

### How to Analyze Intersections

1.  **Prioritize:**
    *   **Which intersections?** Focus on those highlighted by historical context (HCA), stakeholders, domain knowledge, or preliminary data scans. Document choices in `templates/intersectional-analysis.md`.
    *   **Got data?** Check if prioritized groups have enough data for meaningful (even if cautious) analysis.

2.  **Disaggregate Metrics:**
    *   Calculate your key fairness metrics (from MIA) for prioritized intersectional subgroups (e.g., calculate TPR difference for {Black women, White women, Black men, White men}).
    *   **Compare:** Look for differences *between* intersectional groups, and compare their results to single-attribute groups or the overall average.
    *   **Document:** Record results in `templates/intersectional-analysis.md`.

3.  **Visualize:** Use charts (heatmaps, bar charts) to show intersectional results clearly.

4.  **(Advanced) Consider Specialized Methods:** If data sparsity is severe:
    *   **Bayesian Methods:** Can give more stable estimates for small groups.
    *   **Subgroup Discovery Algorithms:** Can search for unexpected attribute combinations with large fairness gaps.
    *   *(Require specific statistical expertise).*

### Practical Steps within the Framework

1.  **Plan:** State prioritized intersections in `assessment-plan.md`.
2.  **Implement (MIA):** Calculate metrics for these intersections.
3.  **Analyze:** Compare results. Look for compounding effects or unique patterns.
4.  **Document:** Use `templates/intersectional-analysis.md` for methodology, results, findings, and limitations.
5.  **Connect:** Link findings back to potential bias sources (BSI) and historical context (HCA).
6.  **Recommend:** Tailor interventions based on intersectional findings.

### Handling Limitations

*   **Acknowledge Sparsity:** If data is too limited for certain intersections, state this clearly in `templates/limitations-acknowledgment.md` and `templates/intersectional-analysis.md`. Avoid overstating findings from small samples.
*   **Use Qualitative Data:** Combine quantitative results with insights from stakeholder engagement (Part 1) for richer context.

Including stakeholder engagement and intersectional analysis makes fairness assessments more robust, context-aware, and likely to address critical issues effectively.
