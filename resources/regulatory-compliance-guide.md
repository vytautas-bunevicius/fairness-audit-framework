# AI Fairness Regulatory Compliance Guide

This guide provides detailed information on regulatory requirements for AI fairness across major jurisdictions, with specific documentation templates and workflows to ensure compliance.

## EU AI Act Requirements

The EU AI Act, effective from 2024, establishes comprehensive requirements for high-risk AI systems, which include systems used in employment, education, law enforcement, and access to essential services.

### Documentation Requirements

For high-risk AI systems under the EU AI Act, providers must maintain and submit the following fairness-related documentation:

**FRIA Template Sections**:
1. System description and purpose
2. Rights potentially impacted (with focus on non-discrimination)
3. Stakeholders affected and their concerns
4. Analysis of impacts on different demographic groups

### Compliance Documentation Workflow

For EU AI Act compliance, follow this sequence:
1. Complete Historical Context Assessment with explicit references to affected fundamental rights
2. Document fairness definitions with connections to EU non-discrimination principles
3. Identify bias sources with severity classified according to fundamental rights impact
4. Implement metrics that align with EU fairness requirements
5. Create technical documentation package following Annex IV structure
6. Develop conformity assessment documentation

## Cross-Regulatory Documentation Framework

To efficiently address multiple regulatory requirements, organize documentation as follows:

### 1. Core Fairness Documentation Set

Create a comprehensive set of core documents using the Fairness Audit Framework templates:
- Historical Context Report
- Fairness Definition Rationale
- Bias Source Mapping
- Metrics Implementation Details
- Intersectional Analysis
- Limitations Acknowledgment
- Executive Summary

### 2. Regulatory-Specific Supplements

For each applicable regulation, create supplement documents that:
- Reference relevant sections of the core documentation
- Add regulatory-specific analyses or formats
- Map core documentation to regulatory requirements
- Highlight any regulatory-specific considerations

### 3. Regulatory Compliance Matrix

Maintain a compliance matrix tracking which documents satisfy which regulatory requirements:

**Example Matrix**:
```
## Regulatory Compliance Matrix

| Requirement | Regulation | Jurisdiction | Addressed By | Status |
|-------------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Technical Documentation | EU AI Act, Article 11 | EU | Technical Documentation Package | Complete |
| Disparate Impact Analysis | ECOA | US | Metrics Implementation + Supplement | Complete |
| Four-Fifths Rule | EEOC Guidelines | US | Metrics Implementation + Supplement | In Progress |
```

## Documentation Standards for Fairness Evidence

### 1. Statistical Evidence Standards

Different regulations require different statistical approaches to demonstrate fairness:

| Regulation | Required Statistical Approach | Implementation |
|------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| EEOC (US) | Four-Fifths Rule, statistical significance | Include specific Four-Fifths Rule calculation |
| ECOA (US) | Comparative file review, regression analysis | Include regression results showing coefficients for protected attributes |
| EU AI Act | Not specific, but requires validation | Include multiple statistical tests with appropriate confidence intervals |

### 2. Documentation Retention Requirements

Maintain documentation according to the most stringent applicable requirements:

| Jurisdiction | Retention Period | Format Requirements |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| EU | Throughout system lifecycle plus 10 years | Electronic, searchable, accessible to authorities |
| US Financial | Minimum 3 years after system retirement | Electronic with backup, audit trail of changes |
| US Employment | Minimum 2 years after system retirement | Electronic or physical, audit trail of changes |

### 3. Expert Validation Requirements

Some regulations require independent validation:

| Regulation | Validation Requirement | Implementation |
|------------|------------------------|---------------|
| EU AI Act | Conformity assessment for high-risk AI | Include independent assessment report |
| SR 11-7 | Independent model validation | Include validation report from independent team |
| EEOC | Validation of job-relatedness | Include documentation of validation studies |

## Practical Implementation Guide

### 1. Regulatory Mapping Process

Before beginning documentation, conduct a thorough regulatory mapping:

1. **Identify applicable regulations**:
   - Based on geography of deployment
   - Based on application domain
   - Based on system risk level

2. **Extract specific requirements**:
   - Documentation requirements
   - Testing requirements
   - Process requirements
   - Ongoing monitoring requirements

3. **Map requirements to framework components**:
   - Identify which framework components satisfy which requirements
   - Note any gaps requiring additional documentation

4. **Create documentation plan**:
   - Timeline aligned with regulatory deadlines
   - Resource allocation
   - Responsibility assignment

### 2. Stakeholder Engagement for Compliance

Engage key stakeholders in the compliance process:

1. **Legal team**: Review documentation for regulatory alignment
2. **Compliance team**: Verify documentation meets requirements
3. **Technical team**: Ensure accurate technical representation
4. **Business owners**: Confirm business process representation
5. **External experts**: Provide independent validation if required

### 3. Continuous Compliance Monitoring

Establish a process for maintaining compliance over time:

1. **Regulatory change monitoring**: Track changes to relevant regulations
2. **Documentation update process**: Procedure for updating documentation
3. **Periodic review schedule**: Regular review of compliance documentation
4. **Compliance testing**: Ongoing testing of system fairness
5. **Incident response plan**: Process for addressing fairness incidents
