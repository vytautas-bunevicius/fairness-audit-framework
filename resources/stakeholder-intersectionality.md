# AI Fairness: Stakeholder Engagement and Intersectional Analysis Guide

This guide covers two critical aspects of fairness assessment: meaningfully engaging diverse stakeholders (Part 1) and analyzing fairness for overlapping, intersectional groups (Part 2).

## Part 1: Engaging Stakeholders Effectively

Fairness isn't just a technical problem; it's deeply social and contextual. Engaging stakeholders, especially those potentially affected by the AI, is crucial.

### Why Engage Stakeholders?

*   **Get Context:** Understand real-world impacts and concerns technical data might miss.
*   **Define "Fairness":** Incorporate diverse values into selecting fairness definitions (FDS).
*   **Identify Harms:** Surface potential negative consequences you might not anticipate.
*   **Spot Bias Sources:** Stakeholders often see potential bias (e.g., in data collection) from their experience.
*   **Build Trust:** A participatory process increases legitimacy and acceptance.
*   **Improve Solutions:** Get practical input on effective interventions.

### Who are the Stakeholders?

Think broadly:
*   **Directly Affected:** People whose lives are impacted by the AI's decisions (e.g., patients, job applicants, loan applicants). *Prioritize these voices.*
*   **System Operators:** People who use the AI daily (e.g., doctors, recruiters, loan officers).
*   **Developers:** The technical team building the AI.
*   **Domain Experts:** People with deep knowledge of the field (e.g., educators, criminologists).
*   **Advocacy Groups:** Organizations representing potentially affected communities.
*   **Legal/Compliance/Ethics:** Internal or external experts ensuring rules and values are met.
*   **Leadership/Business Owners:** Those responsible for the system's deployment and outcomes.

**Action:** Map your stakeholders using `templates/assessment-plan.md` and consider power dynamics. Plan *how* and *when* to engage each group using `templates/stakeholder-documentation.md` to track activities and input.

### How to Engage (Methods)

Choose methods appropriate for the goal and the stakeholders:
*   **Interviews:** Good for deep understanding from individuals.
*   **Workshops (Co-design):** Excellent for collaborative problem-solving, definition setting, or interpreting results. Requires careful facilitation (see below).
*   **Surveys:** Useful for broader input on specific questions.
*   **Feedback Sessions:** Presenting findings and getting reactions.
*   **Advisory Panels:** Ongoing input from a dedicated group.

### Facilitating Equitable Engagement

Simply inviting people isn't enough. Ensure meaningful participation:
*   **Accessibility:** Consider language, technical knowledge, physical/virtual access needs, timing.
*   **Manage Power:** Actively ensure dominant voices don't drown out others. Use techniques like round-robin speaking, anonymous input options, or small, balanced breakout groups.
*   **Psychological Safety:** Set clear ground rules for respectful dialogue. Acknowledge different forms of expertise (lived experience is expertise!).
*   **Transparency:** Be clear about how input will be used and what decisions have already been made.
*   **Compensation:** Value stakeholders' time and expertise, especially for members of the public or advocacy groups.
*   **Document Carefully:** Get consent, clarify attribution preferences (anonymous, named?), and share summaries back for validation. Use `templates/stakeholder-documentation.md`.

### Integrating Input

*   **Systematically Link:** Connect stakeholder input directly to specific parts of the assessment (e.g., "This historical pattern was validated in the community workshop," "This fairness definition was prioritized based on patient advocate feedback"). Document this in the relevant templates and summarize in `templates/stakeholder-documentation.md`.
*   **Address Disagreements:** Don't ignore conflicting views. Document them and the rationale for the final decision made.

## Part 2: Analyzing Intersectional Fairness

People often belong to multiple demographic groups (e.g., race, gender, age, disability). Intersectionality examines fairness at these overlaps, as experiences of bias can be unique and compounded.

### Why Analyze Intersections?

*   **Reveal Hidden Bias:** An AI might look fair for men vs. women *and* fair for white vs. Black individuals, but be very unfair specifically to Black women. Single-attribute analysis misses this.
*   **Understand Compounding Effects:** Disadvantage can stack up in unexpected ways.
*   **Target Interventions:** Fixes might need to be tailored to specific intersectional groups.

### Challenges

*   **Data Sparsity:** As you combine more attributes, subgroups get very small, making statistics unreliable.
*   **Complexity:** The number of intersections grows rapidly.
*   **Prioritization:** You can't always analyze *every* possible intersection.

### How to Analyze Intersections (Approaches)

1.  **Prioritize Intersections:**
    *   **Which intersections matter most?** Focus on those with known historical context issues (from HCA), those raised by stakeholders, or those most relevant to the specific potential harms of the AI. Document your choices in `templates/intersectional-analysis.md`.
    *   **Data Check:** Ensure you have *enough* data for prioritized intersections to make analysis meaningful (even if "enough" is small, acknowledge it).

2.  **Disaggregate Standard Metrics:**
    *   Calculate your main fairness metrics (from MIA) not just for single groups (men vs. women) but for the *prioritized intersectional subgroups* (e.g., Black women, White women, Black men, White men).
    *   **Compare:** Look for significant differences *between* intersectional groups and how their results compare to the single-attribute groups or the overall average.
    *   **Document:** Use `templates/intersectional-analysis.md` to record these disaggregated results.

3.  **Visualize:** Use charts (like heatmaps or bar charts comparing subgroup performance) to make complex intersectional results easier to understand.

4.  **(Advanced) Use Specialized Methods:** If data sparsity is a major issue or deeper insight is needed:
    *   **Bayesian Methods:** Can provide more stable estimates for small groups by "borrowing" information across related groups.
    *   **Subgroup Discovery Algorithms:** Can automatically search for combinations of attributes (not just protected ones) that show large fairness gaps.
    *   *(These are advanced and require specific statistical expertise).*

### Practical Steps

1.  **Plan:** In your `assessment-plan.md`, explicitly state which intersections will be prioritized for analysis and why.
2.  **Implement:** During the Metrics Implementation stage (MIA), calculate metrics for these prioritized intersections alongside single-attribute groups.
3.  **Analyze:** Compare results. Are disparities larger at intersections? Are there unexpected patterns?
4.  **Document:** Use `templates/intersectional-analysis.md` to detail:
    *   Which intersections were analyzed.
    *   The methodology used (e.g., simple disaggregation, Bayesian model).
    *   The results for each intersectional group.
    *   Key findings and interpretations.
    *   Any limitations due to data sparsity.
5.  **Connect:** Link intersectional findings back to potential bias sources (BSI) and historical context (HCA).
6.  **Recommend:** Tailor recommendations based on intersectional findings.

### Handling Limitations

*   **Acknowledge Sparsity:** If data is too sparse for some intersections, clearly state this in `templates/limitations-acknowledgment.md` and `templates/intersectional-analysis.md`. Don't over-interpret noisy results from tiny groups.
*   **Qualitative Data:** Supplement sparse quantitative data with qualitative insights from stakeholder engagement.

By deliberately including stakeholder engagement and intersectional analysis, your fairness assessment becomes more robust, context-aware, and likely to identify and address the most critical fairness issues.
