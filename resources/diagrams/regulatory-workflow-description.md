# Regulatory Compliance Workflow Diagram Description

This file contains a text description of the regulatory compliance workflow diagram, which should be replaced with an actual diagram image file when created.

## Diagram Structure

The regulatory compliance workflow diagram illustrates the documentation-focused fairness assessment process designed specifically for regulatory submission and compliance verification. It shows a systematic flow through seven key stages with their interconnections, documentation requirements, and regulatory touchpoints.

## Visual Elements

The diagram should include:

1. **Process Boxes**: Seven rectangular boxes representing each stage of the workflow:
   - Regulatory Mapping
   - Historical Context Documentation
   - Fairness Definition Justification
   - Comprehensive Bias Documentation
   - Metrics Implementation & Validation
   - Evidence Compilation
   - Compliance Documentation Package

2. **Flow Arrows**: Directional arrows showing the primary flow between stages
   - Solid arrows for primary workflow
   - Dashed arrows for documentation flows and regulatory verification points

3. **Documentation Requirements**: Document stack icons with regulatory-specific labels at each stage

4. **Regulatory Verification Points**: Checkmark icons indicating key regulatory verification touchpoints

5. **Legal Reference Connectors**: Small legal document icons connecting relevant regulations to specific workflow stages

## Content Details

### Stage 1: Regulatory Mapping
- Inputs: Applicable regulations, compliance requirements, system documentation
- Activities: Regulatory inventory, requirement mapping, documentation planning
- Outputs: Regulatory Requirement Matrix, Evidence Requirements Catalog
- Regulatory Focus: Identification of all applicable requirements and standards
- Connected to: All subsequent stages with requirements flow

### Stage 2: Historical Context Documentation
- Inputs: Historical research, legal precedents, regulatory guidance
- Activities: Pattern documentation with regulatory framing, legal precedent analysis
- Outputs: Regulatory-focused Historical Pattern Registry, Legal Precedent Analysis
- Regulatory Focus: Documented historical patterns relevant to specific regulations
- Connected to: Fairness Definition Justification, Comprehensive Bias Documentation

### Stage 3: Fairness Definition Justification
- Inputs: Regulatory requirements, historical patterns, legal standards
- Activities: Definition selection with regulatory alignment, formal justification
- Outputs: Regulatory-aligned Fairness Definitions, Formal Definition Justification
- Regulatory Focus: Explicit connection between definitions and regulatory requirements
- Connected to: Comprehensive Bias Documentation, Metrics Implementation

### Stage 4: Comprehensive Bias Documentation
- Inputs: Regulatory risk areas, fairness definitions, system documentation
- Activities: Exhaustive bias source documentation, regulatory risk assessment
- Outputs: Comprehensive Bias Source Catalog, Regulatory Risk Assessment
- Regulatory Focus: Thorough documentation meeting evidentiary standards
- Connected to: Metrics Implementation, Evidence Compilation

### Stage 5: Metrics Implementation & Validation
- Inputs: Fairness definitions, bias sources, regulatory thresholds
- Activities: Rigorous metric implementation, statistical validation, threshold analysis
- Outputs: Regulatory Metrics Package, Statistical Validation Documentation
- Regulatory Focus: Statistical rigor meeting evidentiary standards
- Connected to: Evidence Compilation, Compliance Documentation

### Stage 6: Evidence Compilation
- Inputs: All previous documentation, regulatory requirements
- Activities: Evidence organization, traceability matrix creation, validation
- Outputs: Evidence Catalog, Traceability Matrix, Methodology Documentation
- Regulatory Focus: Structured evidence package aligned with regulatory expectations
- Connected to: Compliance Documentation Package

### Stage 7: Compliance Documentation Package
- Inputs: Complete evidence package, regulatory requirements
- Activities: Final documentation creation, compliance verification, submission preparation
- Outputs: Complete Compliance Documentation Package, Executive Summary
- Regulatory Focus: Submission-ready materials meeting all requirements
- Connected to: Regulatory submission and governance review

## Regulatory Framework Adaptation

The diagram should include elements showing adaptation to different regulatory frameworks:

1. A tabbed section showing specific adaptations for:
   - EU AI Act Requirements
   - EEOC/US Employment Requirements
   - Financial Services Regulations
   - Healthcare Compliance Standards

2. Connector lines showing how these specific requirements flow into appropriate workflow stages

## Evidence Standards Elements

Include visual elements highlighting evidence standards:
1. "Evidentiary Standard" indicators at documentation outputs
2. "Statistical Validation" markers at appropriate stages
3. "Documentation Completeness" checklist connectors

## Verification and Validation Flow

The diagram should show a distinct validation flow:
1. Internal verification checkpoints at each stage
2. Legal/compliance review touchpoints
3. Pre-submission validation process
4. Post-submission response preparation

## Color Coding

The diagram should use color coding to indicate:
1. Documentation-focused activities (blue)
2. Verification activities (green)
3. Regulatory alignment activities (purple)
4. Evidence standards (orange)
5. Submission preparation (red)

## Legend

Include a legend explaining:
1. Box shapes and meanings
2. Arrow types
3. Icon meanings
4. Color coding
5. Regulatory framework indicators

## Notes for Implementation

This text description should be used to create an actual diagram using appropriate visualization software. The resulting image file (PNG or SVG format) should replace this description file in the repository.
