# Rapid Assessment Workflow Diagram Description

This file contains a text description of the rapid workflow diagram, which should be replaced with an actual diagram image file when created.

## Diagram Structure

The rapid assessment workflow diagram illustrates the streamlined fairness assessment process for initial screening or lower-risk AI systems. It shows a simplified flow through five key stages with their interconnections and information flows.

## Visual Elements

The diagram should include:

1. **Process Boxes**: Five rectangular boxes representing each stage of the workflow:
   - Scoping & Context
   - Key Fairness Definitions
   - Critical Bias Analysis
   - Core Metrics Evaluation
   - Findings & Recommendations

2. **Flow Arrows**: Directional arrows showing the primary flow between stages
   - Solid arrows for primary flow
   - Dashed arrows for information flows between non-adjacent components

3. **Input/Output Connectors**: Small document icons next to appropriate stages indicating documentation inputs and outputs

4. **Decision Point**: Single diamond shape after Findings & Recommendations indicating whether to:
   - Conclude assessment as sufficient
   - Transition to comprehensive assessment if issues warrant deeper investigation

5. **Time Indicators**: Small clock icons showing the approximate time allocation for each stage

## Content Details

### Stage 1: Scoping & Context
- Inputs: System documentation, stakeholder input
- Activities: Quick system review, targeted literature search, key pattern identification
- Outputs: Mini Historical Context Report, System Risk Profile
- Time Allocation: 1-2 days
- Connected to: Key Fairness Definitions, Critical Bias Analysis

### Stage 2: Key Fairness Definitions
- Inputs: Mini Historical Context Report, system purpose
- Activities: Streamlined definition selection, basic trade-off analysis
- Outputs: Primary Fairness Definition with rationale, Secondary Definition (if needed)
- Time Allocation: 0.5-1 day
- Connected to: Critical Bias Analysis, Core Metrics Evaluation

### Stage 3: Critical Bias Analysis
- Inputs: Historical context, fairness definitions
- Activities: Abbreviated lifecycle analysis, high-risk bias source identification
- Outputs: Critical Bias Source List, Abbreviated Risk Assessment
- Time Allocation: 1-2 days
- Connected to: Core Metrics Evaluation, Findings & Recommendations

### Stage 4: Core Metrics Evaluation
- Inputs: Fairness definitions, critical bias sources
- Activities: Focused metric implementation, basic statistical analysis
- Outputs: Core Metrics Results, Initial Disparity Assessment
- Time Allocation: 1-2 days
- Connected to: Findings & Recommendations

### Stage 5: Findings & Recommendations
- Inputs: All previous outputs
- Activities: Synthesis of findings, prioritization of issues, recommendation development
- Outputs: Key Findings Report, Prioritized Recommendations, Assessment Limitations
- Time Allocation: 1 day
- Connected to: Decision Point for next steps

## Expansion Path

The diagram should include a clear path showing how the rapid assessment can expand to a comprehensive assessment if needed:

1. A decision diamond after Findings & Recommendations labeled "Further Assessment Needed?"
2. Two output paths:
   - "No" path: "Complete Documentation and Finalize"
   - "Yes" path: "Transition to Comprehensive Assessment" with an arrow pointing to a box representing the comprehensive workflow

## Documentation Simplification

The diagram should indicate documentation simplification through:
1. "Essential Sections Only" tags on documentation icons
2. "Abbreviated" labels on analysis components
3. "Focused" indicators on scope elements

## Time Efficiency Elements

Include visual elements highlighting time efficiency:
1. Clock icons showing approximate duration for each stage
2. "Quick Win" indicators for highest-value activities
3. "Depth vs. Speed" balance indicators at key decision points

## Color Coding

The diagram should use color coding to indicate:
1. Critical path activities (red)
2. Supporting activities that can be simplified (yellow)
3. Required documentation elements (blue)
4. Decision points (green)

## Legend

Include a legend explaining:
1. Box shapes and meanings
2. Arrow types
3. Icon meanings
4. Color coding
5. Time allocation indicators

## Notes for Implementation

This text description should be used to create an actual diagram using appropriate visualization software. The resulting image file (PNG or SVG format) should replace this description file in the repository.
