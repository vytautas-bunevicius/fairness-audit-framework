### Initial Observations

[Brief description of the alert context and initial observations from the monitoring dashboard.]

## Investigation Scope and Methodology

### Investigation Goals

[Specific questions the investigation aimed to answer.]

### Methodology

[Describe the steps taken during the investigation (e.g., data analysis, code review, stakeholder interviews).]

### Tools Used

[List specific tools used for analysis (e.g., SQL queries, Python notebooks, What-If Tool).]

### Data Analyzed

- **Time Period**: [Start and end dates for data analyzed]
- **Data Sources**: [Specific logs or databases queried]
- **Subgroups Focused On**: [Specific subgroups analyzed in detail]

## Analysis Findings

### Alert Validation

[Confirm whether the alert represents a genuine fairness drift or a false positive. Provide evidence.]

### Data Distribution Analysis

- **Feature Drift**: [Analysis of input feature distributions over the period]
- **Label Drift**: [Analysis of ground truth label distribution changes, if applicable]
- **Subgroup Composition Shift**: [Analysis of changes in the demographic makeup of users/inputs]

### Model Behavior Analysis

- **Prediction Score Distribution**: [Analysis of changes in model prediction scores]
- **Model Performance Changes**: [Changes in accuracy, precision, recall etc.]
- **Feature Importance Shifts**: [If applicable, analysis of changes in feature importance]

### Fairness Metric Deep Dive

- **Trend Analysis**: [Detailed trend of the affected fairness metric(s)]
- **Subgroup Impact Analysis**: [Which specific subgroups are most affected by the drift?]
- **Intersectional Effects**: [Were specific intersections disproportionately affected?]

### External Factor Analysis

[Consideration of external events or changes that might have influenced the drift (e.g., policy changes, real-world events, upstream data source changes).]

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypotheses Considered

1. [Hypothesis 1]: [Description] - [Evidence For/Against]
2. [Hypothesis 2]: [Description] - [Evidence For/Against]
3. [Hypothesis 3]: [Description] - [Evidence For/Against]

### Identified Root Cause(s)

[Clearly state the determined root cause(s) of the fairness drift, with supporting evidence.]

**Confidence in Root Cause**: [High/Medium/Low]

### Contributing Factors

[List any secondary factors that may have contributed to the drift.]

## Impact Assessment

### Severity Classification

- **Magnitude of Drift**: [Quantify the size of the fairness disparity]
- **Affected Population**: [Estimate number/proportion of users affected]
- **Potential Harm**: [Assess the potential harm caused by the drift]
- **Regulatory Impact**: [Consider any compliance implications]
- **Overall Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]

### Urgency Assessment

[Assess the urgency required for remediation.]

## Recommendations

### Short-Term Actions

[Immediate actions recommended (e.g., rollback, temporary adjustments, further monitoring).]

### Long-Term Remediation

[Recommendations for addressing the root cause (link to Remediation Plan Template).]

### Monitoring Adjustments

[Recommendations for adjusting monitoring thresholds, metrics, or frequency based on findings.]

## Limitations

[Acknowledge any limitations of the investigation (e.g., data availability, time constraints).]

## Next Steps

- **Remediation Plan Creation**: [Assignee and deadline]
- **Stakeholder Communication**: [Plan for communicating findings]
- **Monitoring Update**: [Assignee and deadline for any monitoring changes]
