## Executive Summary

[Brief overview of the monitoring findings for this period. Highlight any significant fairness metric drifts, alerts triggered, investigations conducted, and remediation actions taken or planned. State the overall fairness status compared to the baseline/previous period. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs.]

## Monitoring Setup Overview

* **Monitored Metrics**: [List of key fairness and supporting metrics tracked]
* **Monitoring Frequency**: [e.g., Daily, Weekly, Monthly]
* **Alert Thresholds**: [Summary of key thresholds used]
* **Data Source**: [Source of data used for monitoring]
* **Monitoring Tools**: [Tools/platforms used]
* *(Reference [setup-configuration.md](./setup-configuration.md)
  and [metrics-and-thresholds.md](./metrics-and-thresholds.md) from initial setup for full
  details)*

## Monitoring Results

### Metric Trends

| Metric     | Baseline Value     | Current Value (Avg/End) | Change   | Trend Interpretation                 | Status (Alert/OK) |
|------------|--------------------|-------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Value @ baseline] | [Value this period]     | [Change] | [e.g., Stable, Improving, Degrading] | [Alert/OK]        |
| [Metric 2] | [Value @ baseline] | [Value this period]     | [Change] | [e.g., Stable, Improving, Degrading] | [Alert/OK]        |
| ...        | ...                | ...                     | ...      | ...                                  | ...               |

*(Include visualizations like time-series plots if applicable)*

### Intersectional Monitoring Results (if applicable)

| Intersection     | Metric   | Baseline Value | Current Value | Change   | Status     |
|------------------|----------|----------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| [Intersection 1] | [Metric] | [Value]        | [Value]       | [Change] | [Alert/OK] |
| ...              | ...      | ...            | ...           | ...      | ...        |

### Data Drift Analysis Summary

[Brief summary of any significant drifts detected in input data distributions relevant to fairness (e.g., changes in demographic proportions).]

## Alerts and Investigations

### Alerts Triggered During Period

| Date   | Metric/Check  | Threshold Breached   | Severity       | Investigation Triggered? |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| [Date] | [Metric Name] | [Value vs Threshold] | [High/Med/Low] | [Yes/No]                 |

### Investigation Summaries

*(For each investigation conducted based on alerts)*

**Investigation ID**: [Unique ID]

* **Trigger**: [Alert details]
* **Findings**: [Summary of root cause analysis - reference [drift-investigation.md](./drift-investigation.md) if used]
* **Impact Assessment**: [Assessed impact of the drift]

*(Reference [remediation-plan.md](./remediation-plan.md) if used)*

### Planned Actions

[List any remediation actions planned for the next period based on current findings.]

## Limitations and Confidence

[Acknowledge any limitations in the monitoring process for this period (e.g., data lags, metric limitations, threshold sensitivity).]
<!-- State overall confidence in the current fairness status based on monitoring. -->

## Conclusion and Recommendations

* **Overall Fairness Status**: [Stable/Improved/Degraded compared to baseline]
* **Key Concerns**: [Highlight persistent or emerging fairness issues]
* **Recommendations**:
    * [Adjust monitoring thresholds?]
    * [Investigate specific areas further?]
    * [Implement specific remediations?]
    * [Update baseline assessment?]
