## Metrics Selection Rationale

[Explain the process and rationale for selecting the metrics below for continuous monitoring, referencing the initial fairness assessment, fairness definitions, and identified risks.]

## Core Fairness Metrics

| Metric ID | Name                                 | Definition Link                     | Subgroups                           | Monitoring Threshold(s)             | Alert Level        | Rationale       |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| [M001]    | [e.g., Equal Opportunity Difference] | [Link to definition/implementation] | [e.g., Gender, Race]                | [e.g., > 0.05 change from baseline] | [Warning/Critical] | [Justification] |
| [M002]    | [e.g., Demographic Parity Ratio]     | [Link to definition/implementation] | [e.g., Age Group]                   | [e.g., < 0.85]                      | [Critical]         | [Justification] |
| [M003]    | [e.g., Calibration Error Disparity]  | [Link to definition/implementation] | [e.g., Intersection: Gender x Race] | [e.g., > 10% relative increase]     | [Warning]          | [Justification] |

## Supporting Metrics (Data Drift, Model Performance)

| Metric ID | Name                                     | Category            | Monitoring Threshold(s)               | Alert Level | Rationale       |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| [S001]    | [e.g., Feature Distribution Shift (PSI)] | [Data Drift]        | [e.g., PSI > 0.2 for key features]    | [Warning]   | [Justification] |
| [S002]    | [e.g., Overall Accuracy]                 | [Model Performance] | [e.g., < 90% of baseline accuracy]    | [Warning]   | [Justification] |
| [S003]    | [e.g., Prediction Confidence Drift]      | [Model Behavior]    | [e.g., Mean confidence change > 5%]   | [Warning]   | [Justification] |
| [S004]    | [e.g., Input Data Volume Change]         | [Data Integrity]    | [e.g., > 20% deviation from expected] | [Info]      | [Justification] |

## Threshold Definitions

[Provide detailed explanations for how thresholds were set, including statistical methods, regulatory requirements, or practical significance considerations.]

### Threshold Setting Methodology

- [Statistical Process Control details, if used]
- [Regulatory references, if applicable]
- [Stakeholder input summary]
- [Baseline variability analysis]

### Alert Level Definitions

- **Info**: [Circumstances triggering informational alerts]
- **Warning**: [Circumstances triggering warning alerts, requiring investigation]
- **Critical**: [Circumstances triggering critical alerts, potentially requiring immediate action]

## Statistical Validation Approach for Monitoring

[Describe the statistical methods used to distinguish genuine drift or threshold breaches from random noise in the monitoring process (e.g., control charts, significance testing over time windows).]

## Metrics Implementation Details

[Reference where the specific implementation details for these metrics can be found (e.g., code repository, Metrics Implementation Details template from the initial assessment).]

## Review and Update Schedule

- **Metrics Review Frequency**: [e.g., Quarterly, Annually]
- **Review Triggers**: [Events triggering metrics/threshold review]
- **Update Process**: [Procedure for updating metrics and thresholds]
